The Migrations Script randomly generates a 1002 users and 2 games with random names, birthdates/dates of death, etc.  New games can be added under the Add/Edit/Update Games page.

In regards to Problem 1: 

Sorting Years by most living players can be viewed under the statistics page.

In regards to Problem 2:

player_id, coins_won, coins_bet, lifetime_spins, lifetime_average_return, and all of the other player specs can be viewed on the View Players page.  

I'm having fun with it, but unfortunately, I wasn't entirely sure what all you wanted me to do with all of those values in the second problem.  Also, I'm kind of running short on time with this due to other client projects, so that's about as far as I got with the second one.  Let me know if you have any questions.
